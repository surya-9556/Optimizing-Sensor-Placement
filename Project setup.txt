Structure of the application:-

1. The complete code is written in jupyter notebook named (final_project.ipynb)
2. To maintian the code consistency and the application readbility a certain structure has been followed:
2.1 .env file will have the dataset names and necessary column names and other attributes
2.2 Functions folder contains all the data cleaning, Optimizing, and testing Functions
2.3 Some Functions are called directly in the final_project.ipynb file some are managed in main.py file
2.4 sensor_placement.json file will have the positions with Sensor names as it is in the actual_locations
2.5 If anyone who wants to test the application with new data try keep the whole data in a ziped file and the type of files needs to be in .xlsx format exactly as how we have recived the data.
2.6 If any wants the change the format and try on their own needs to be modified by going to Functions folder and into extracting_file.py file
2.7 The dataset ziped file can be in any location but the file location should be passed through .env file in order to follow the companies secrets policy.

this the flow and structure of the application it's complex to understand by i haven't got time to completely adjut it for the whole application sorry for that.
